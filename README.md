# Cat and Dog Image Classification with Deep Learning

This repository contains code for training a deep learning model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on the Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset, which you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog). The goal is to create a model that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset. It contains a large collection of labeled images of cats and dogs for training and testing the model.
You can download the dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog).

## Code Overview

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, you'll need to install the required libraries and have Python and PyTorch set up on your machine. You can install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
